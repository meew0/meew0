### ðŸ«€ meew0 ðŸŒŒ

Hello! I am meew0, among other names. I live in central Europe and work in a field unrelated to programming. Like, really unrelated. Nobody I work with knows what GitHub is. This is the space for my (hobby) projects.

In the past I used to be really active in the Discord API community, and many of my older projects will illustrate that, but nowadays I mainly make software that I need for my own purposes. I try to make everything public that is at least slightly usable, in the spirit of sharing, but expect most projects to be very unpolished.

If you would like to contact me, feel free to send an email to my most recent git committer email address. I make no promises about responding, though. You can also ping me on [fedi](https://iscute.moe/meew0).

My profile picture is a combination of my own artwork and elements traced from various frames of the [To Your Eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Your_Eternity) anime.
